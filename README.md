# AvL P.T.P üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Nestwork Division


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Athul Anoop - College of Engineering Trivandrum

### Project Description
AvL P.T.P (Avian Logistics Pigeon Transfer Protocol) is the best and fastest way to share text, files, images, etc... across devices. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
AvL P.T.P aims to make transferring anything between your devices as fast as possible, using pigeons because gigabit ethernet doesnt cut it for the most demanding users. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Pigeon Transfer Protocol achieves transfer speeds beyond what the latest gigabit ethernet connection technology can do. It achieves this by collaborating deeply with pigeoneers of nestworking to bring the speed of pigeons to our users.
